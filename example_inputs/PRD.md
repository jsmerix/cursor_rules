## **Product Requirements Document: Personal Task Manager**

### **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the product requirements for a Personal Task Manager, a simple web application designed to help individuals organize and track their daily tasks. The application will provide a straightforward interface for users to add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks.

### **2\. Goals**

* **Simplify Task Management:** Provide an intuitive and easy-to-use platform for managing personal tasks.  
* **Enhance Productivity:** Help users stay organized and focused on their priorities.  
* **Cross-Device Accessibility:** Be accessible from any web browser on various devices.

### **3\. Target Audience**

This application is intended for individuals who need a basic, no-frills tool to keep track of their personal to-do lists, students managing assignments, or small business owners tracking daily chores.

### **4\. Key Features**

* **Task Creation:** Users can add new tasks with a title.  
* **Task Viewing:** Users can view a list of all active and completed tasks.  
* **Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as complete.  
* **Task Deletion:** Users can remove tasks from their list.

### **5\. User Stories**

* **As a user,** I want to add a new task so I can remember what I need to do.  
* **As a user,** I want to see a list of my current tasks so I know my pending work.  
* **As a user,** I want to mark a task as complete so I can track my progress.  
* **As a user,** I want to delete an old task so my list stays clean.  
* **As a user,** I want to view my tasks on my mobile phone while I'm on the go.

### **6\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:**  
  * Page load times for task lists should be under 2 seconds.  
  * Task creation/update operations should complete within 1 second.  
* **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and require minimal learning.  
* **Security:** Basic security measures to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF â€“ though for a single-user app, these are less critical, but good practice). Data privacy should be maintained.  
* **Scalability:** Initial focus on single-user, but the architecture should allow for future expansion to multiple users if required (e.g., authentication system).  
* **Accessibility:** Adhere to basic web accessibility guidelines (e.g., proper semantic HTML).

### **7\. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1)**

* User accounts and authentication.  
* Task due dates and reminders.  
* Task categorization/tagging.  
* Search and filtering capabilities.  
* Integration with calendars.
