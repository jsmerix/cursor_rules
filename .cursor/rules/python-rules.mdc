- When generating Python code always use type hints via `typing` library
- Use test driven development TDD in a following way:
    1. When implementing a new feature, check if there are tests for it already, if not, create them first
    2. Once tests are implemented, build the requested feature using as little code as possible in order to pass the tests
    3. After finishing implementaton - run the tests, if they pass, all good, if not, ask the user for next command
- When building new features always update README.md with appropriate documentation
- Always generate docstrings for functions
