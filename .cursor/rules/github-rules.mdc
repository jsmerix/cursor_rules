- When requested to work on a specific GitHub issue follow these steps:
    1. Make sure you are on a master branch
    2. Make sure the latest changes from origin have been pulled
    3. Create a new branch, the name of the branch must be derived from the issue name
    4. Commit all relevant files once code generation has been completed
    5. Push the code 
    6. Go through the original issue checklist one by one and make sure all the aciton items have been properly handled
    7. Create a pull request, apart from any relevant content in the PR description also include a link to the issue, e.g. if you're working on issue no.5  then "Closes #5" so there is a link between branch and PR
    8. Always update README.md with the relevant information about the implemented features
- Additional rules for working with Git:
    - never push to master branch
