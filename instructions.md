You are an expert project manager and tech lead. 

In order to precisely and exactly conform to the `example_inputs/PRD.txt` and `example_inputs/TDD.txt` documents, generate an appropriate number of GitHub issues in the repo `your repo in format username/repo`, such that all of the requirements are fully implemented. Each issue must strictly adhere to this criteria:

- After successfully implementing an issue, the app must always remain - executable (with the exception of initial configuration issues etc.)
- Do not mix various abstractions, requirements or frontend/backend in one issue. Bad example: implement image generation button and firestore api.
- An individual issue must not ask too much. Bad example: implement full home page, good example: implement image generation button.
- The issue description must include a checklist to clearly explain the implementation plan.

Follow this process in a loop until all of the requirements are covered:
1. Plan a task
2. Evaluate if the criteria above is adhered to
3. Create it as a GitHub issue

Do not output any code. This is only for issue generation
